			<h2>My name is Kelvin</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a Nigerian guy with an avid passion for all things tech related,
				however, I am mainly involved with Frontend Development. My forte is
				taking product designs and transforming them to life using
				Web-Development skills and technologies.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				I am a student at the University of Lagos and at present, I am a
				freelance Software Engineer ready to work remotely or on-site.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				As a Software Engineer, I strive to offer what the client wants to gain,
				a functional and professional project design execution. I often like to
				communicate with the client as the project advances so we can come out
				with the best possible design solution. My portfolio website is really
				diverse in range containing everything from responsiveness,
				functionality, and incorporation of external tools and libraies. I would
				prefer to have my work speak for itself so feel free to flick through.
